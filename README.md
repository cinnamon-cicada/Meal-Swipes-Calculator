# Meal Swipes Calculator
## Make the most of your meal plan!

# About
After seeing how many people were left with 100+ meal swipes at the end of every semester, this calculator was born. Users will input 1) number of meal swipes; and 2) remaining number of days off from school. After pressing 'Calculate', they'll see the number of swipes they need to use per day to use up all their meal swipes.
Happy calculating!
