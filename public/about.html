        <h1>about the calculator</h1>
        <h2 class="description">335 swipes. three meals a day. how hard could it be to use them all? <br /><br /> very, as it
            turned out. at the end of the 2024 fall semester, some friends had upwards of a hundred and fifty swipes. what
            could've helped? none other than a calculator! <br /><br /> what started as a messy spreadsheet evolved into
            this site. as it helped me get down to one meal swipe (a whole other story), i hope it can help you as well :)

            <ul>
                <li>break calculation: the calculation for breaks is exclusive of the end day. if you have a break from 2/20
                    to 2/25, for instance, the break is calculated as 5 days--not 6.</li><br />
                <li>calendar input: typing multiple dates seems a bit tedious. might add a calendar api. keep an eye out!</li>
